This year's BlackboxNLP workshop will have a hybrid programme. The first half of the program is entirely virtual, 
the second half is going to be hosted both on-site and online. All plenary sessions will be held (either livestreamed or broadcasted) in Zoom
and followed by a live Q&A (unless the schedule indicates otherwise). Questions can be asked in the Zoom chat during the presentations. 
Poster sessions will be held in Gather.town. 
**The links to the zoom session and Gather.town space can be found on the EMNLP page of the workshop** (only accessible with conference registration).
