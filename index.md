## Workshop description

Neural networks have rapidly become a central component in NLP systems in the last few years. 
The improvement in accuracy and performance brought by the introduction of neural networks has typically come at the cost of our understanding of the system: How do we assess what the representations and computations are that the network learns? 
The goal of this workshop is to bring together people who are attempting to peek inside the neural network black box, taking inspiration from machine learning, psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience. 
The topics of the workshop will include, but are not limited to:

- Applying analysis techniques from neuroscience to analyse high-dimensional vector representations (such as Haxby et al., 2001; Kriegeskorte, 2008) in artificial neural networks;
- Analyzing the network's response to strategically chosen inputs in order to infer the linguistic generalizations that the network has acquired (e.g., Linzen et al., 2016; Hupkes et al., 2020);
- Examining the performance of the network on simplified or formal languages (e.g., Hupkes et al., 2018; Lake et al., 2018);
- Proposing modifications to neural network architectures that can make them more interpretable (e.g., Palanki et al., 2018);
- Scaling up neural network analysis techniques developed in the connectionist literature in the 1990s (Elman, 1991); 
- Testing whether interpretable information can be decoded from intermediate representations (e.g., Adi et al.,  2017; Chrupala et al., 2017; Hupkes et al., 2017, Conneau et al., 2018);
- Translating insights on neural networks interpretation from the vision domain (e.g., Zeiler & Fergus, 2014) to language;
- Explaining model predictions (e.g., Lei et al., 2016; Alvarez-Melis & Jaakkola, 2017): What are ways to explain specific decisions made by neural networks?
- Adversarial examples in NLP (e.g., Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Belinkov & Bisk, 2018): How to generate them and how to evaluate their quality?
- Open-source tools for analyzing neural networks in NLP (e.g., Strobelt et al., 2018; Rikters, 2018).
- Evaluation of analysis results: How do we know that the analysis is valid?
- Analysing the linguistic properties captured by contextualised word representations (e.g. Aina et al 2019, Bommasani et al., 2020)
- Analysing learning and inference mechanisms of neural networks, such as memory and attention (e.g. Abnar and Zuidema, 2020, Serrano and Smith, 2019, Haviv et al., 2019)

BlackboxNLP 2021 is the fourth BlackboxNLP workshop. 
The programme and proceedings of the previous editions, which were held at EMNLP 2018, ACL 2019 and EMNLP 2020, can be found [here](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/2018/), [here](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/2019/) and [here](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/2020/).

The official call for papers is available [here](cfp.txt).

## Paper submission 

We accept two types of papers

- <b>Archival papers</b>. These are papers reporting on completed, original and unpublished research, with maximum length of 8 pages + references. Papers shorter than this maximum are also welcome. An optional appendix may appear after the references in the same pdf file. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should report on obtained results rather than intended work. These papers will undergo double-blind peer-review, and should thus be anonymized. Archival papers will be included in the workshop proceedings and the ACL anthology.

- <b>Extended abstracts</b>. These may report on work in progress or may be cross submissions that have already appeared in a non-NLP venue. The extended abstracts are of maximum 2 pages + references. These submissions are non-archival in order to allow submission to another venue. The selection will not be based on a double-blind review and thus submissions of this type need not be anonymized. Abstracts will be posted on the workshop website but will not be included in the proceedings.

Both papers and abstracts should follow the official EMNLP 2020 style guidelines and should be submitted via softconf:

[https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2021/BlackboxNLP](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2021/BlackboxNLP)

Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop: most as posters, some as oral presentations (determined by the program committee).

## Dual submissions and preprints 
Dual submissions with the main conference are allowed, but authors must declare dual submission by entering the paper's main conference submission id.
The reviews for the submission for the main conference will be automatically forwarded to the workshop and taken into consideration when your paper is evaluated.
Authors of dual-submission papers accepted to the main conference should retract them from the workshop by September 20.

Papers posted to preprint servers such as arxiv can be submitted
without any restrictions on when they were posted.

## Camera-ready information
Authors of accepted archival papers should upload the final version of their paper to the submission system by the camera-ready deadline. Authors may use one extra page to address reviewer comments, for a total of nine pages.
